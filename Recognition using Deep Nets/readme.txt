1. Windows OS used with Jupyter Notebook for each part of the project.

2. Since it is Jupyter notebook, it can be run directly, provided all requirements (libraries) are satisfied.

3. For extension, Kaggle dataset is used - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10. Transfer learning is done on predefined network, hence it is important to download the residual network before executing the notebook.
