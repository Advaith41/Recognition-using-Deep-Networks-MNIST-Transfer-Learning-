1. Windows OS used with Jupyter Notebook for each part of the project. **Asked in Piazza, made sure to comment as required and the structure maintained as expected for neural networks.

2. Since it is Jupyter notebook, it can be run directly, provided all requirements (libraries) are satisfied.

3. For extension, Kaggle dataset is used - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10. Transfer learning is done on predefined network, hence it is important to download the residual network before executing the notebook.

4. 3 time travelling days are used for this assignment.
